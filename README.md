# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this project was to gain familiarity with using Microsoft Excel to analyze large sets of data.  It was done as part of my Week 1 project for my DU coding bootcamp.  My work with the data set included:
* filtering data, conditional formatting, and freezing panes - to more easily see and group the data;
* finding averages and using UNIX timestamps;
* pivot tables and splitting data into multiple columns;
* Vlookup functions
* statistics: 
  - central tendancy - mean, mode, median;
  - measureing spread - standard deviation, IQR, outliers
  - data visualization - box plots, line graphs, etc
* and COUNTIF functions
## Analysis and Challenges

## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date? 
At first glance, it seems that theater kickstarters launched in the summer are the substantially more successful in comparison to the rest of the year.  The graph indicates that May is the most successful, followed by June, then July, with success rates of 66.9%, 65.4%, and 63.0%, respectively.  If one lookes at the graph alone, they might conclude that kickstarters launched between May-July, are exceedingly more successful.  However, if you calculate out the percent success (successful campaigns divided by total campaigns), it becomes obvious, that most months are similarly successful.  

The average percent success is 60.6% with a standard deviation of 4.2%, yielding 56.4%-64.8% success rate +/- 1 standard deviation.  December is the only month that falls outside this range, with a rate of 49.3% success, which is in the -3 standard deviation range.  In reality, May and June are the only two months that are higher than the 1 standard deviation range mentioned above, but this is barely the case, espcecially for June.  

So yes, if Louise can arrange to launch her kickstarter in May, followed by June, she will be more likely to succeed than any other month; but in reality, her chance of success is pretty even through out the year, excluding December.

    What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    What are some limitations of this dataset?
    What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
