# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project
### This is my Week 1 project for my DU coding bootcamp.  The purpose of the project was to gain familiarity with using Microsoft Excel to analyze large sets of data.  This included:
* filtering data, conditional formatting, and freezing panes - to more easily see and group the data;
* finding averages and using UNIX timestamps;
* pivot tables and splitting data into multiple columns;
* Vlookup functions
* statistics: 
  - central tendancy - mean, mode, median;
  - measureing spread - standard deviation, IQR, outliers
  - data visualization - box plots, line graphs, etc
* and COUNTIF functions
